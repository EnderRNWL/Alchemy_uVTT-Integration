# uATT - Universal Alchemy Tabletop
## A fan-made uVTT integration for the Alchemy RPG Virtual Tabletop.
### Alchemy's map integration is annoying.
Having to resize maps to be a specific resolution just so the grid can *KINDA* align with the image is annoying to deal with; that's something all of us can agree with. If the map is too big, the grid won't fit the map, and the same applies for the opposite.

That's why we wanted to integrate the uVTT map format into Alchemy, as it would allow for popular map creation software like Dungeon Alchemist and Dungeondraft to easily be compatible with Alchemy without having to deal with image resizing.
